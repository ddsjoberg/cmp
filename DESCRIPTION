Description: Use two independently estimated risks of death from other
    causes and death from disease to get a corrected estimate of risk of
    death from disease.  For example, given a patient's risk of death from
    cancer based on their oncologic burden and their risk of death from
    other causes based on their comorbidities, we calculate an adjusted
    risk of death from cancer. To illustrate the importance of this
    correction, image two patients with identical disease burden, and
    therefore, identical predicted risk of death from disease.  Now
    imagine, that one of these patients also has sever heart disease and
    it likely we pass away from hear disease before they would succumb to
    the cancer. Our correction makes the appropriate update to the risk of
    death from disease incorporating the risk of death from other causes.
