Use two independently estimated risks of death from other causes and death from disease to get a corrected estimate of risk of death from disease.
For example, given a patient's risk of death from cancer based on their oncologic burden and their risk of death from other causes based on their comorbidities, we calculate an adjusted risk of death from cancer. To illustrate the importance of this correction, image two patients with identical disease burden, and
therefore, identical predicted risk of death from disease.
Now imagine, that one of these patients also has sever heart disease and it likely we pass away from hear disease before they would succumb to the cancer.
Our correction makes the appropriate update to the risk of death from disease incorporating the risk of death from other causes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of crc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ddsjoberg/crc")
```

## Example

In the example below, we see how the risk for two patients are updated: one healthy and the other comrobid with a high probability of death from other causes.

```{r example}
library(crc)

update_cancer_death_risk(
  risk_cancer_death = c(0.2, 0.2),
  risk_other_cause = c(0.01, 0.95),
  time = 10
)
```
